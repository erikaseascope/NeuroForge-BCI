**Recursive AI Swarm for Safe BCI Engineering**

The first open-source autonomous engineering framework that designs, simulates, validates, iterates, and certifies brain-computer interfaces — with unbreakable human oversight and zero tolerance for real biological data.

## ✨ Core Features
- 7 specialized BCI agent clusters (Neuralink-inspired)
- Full recursive iteration loops
- Mandatory HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) gates on every high-risk action
- Private encrypted shards — never touches raw neural data
- Audit trails with cryptographic signing
- Synthetic-only simulation
- Streamlit dashboard + real-time metrics
- Built-in regulatory alignment notes

## Safety First
This is **research & simulation only**. No real patient data. Ever.  
See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full protocol.

## Quick Start (once code is added)
1. Clone or fork the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the dashboard
